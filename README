This fork is for use on the RPi to program arduino boards without USB.

Since the internal UART doesn't have a DTR-Pin, this version Makes wPi-Pin 28 HIGH instead (GPIO 38).  
This allows the use of an external circuit to this pin (HIGH signal needs to pull reset low) to program e.g. an Arduino Nano.

See the documentation file for the details.
